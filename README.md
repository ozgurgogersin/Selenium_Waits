# Selenium Wait Demo

Welcome to the "Selenium Wait Demo" repository! This project showcases practical Selenium WebDriver automation tests written in Java with a focus on using explicit waits.

## Features

### Register Test (Disabled)
The "Register" test demonstrates the use of explicit waits when filling out a registration form on a sample webpage. It showcases interactions with elements like gender selection, input fields, and buttons.

### Test Case 1 - Valid Credentials
This test focuses on logging in with valid credentials. It showcases the use of explicit waits for login, input, and verification of successful login.

### Test Case 2 - Wrong Email
In this test, an incorrect email is used for login. Explicit waits are used to handle input and validate the error message.

### Test Case 3 - Wrong Password
The test checks what happens when a wrong password is used for login. It uses explicit waits for input and error message validation.

### Test Case 4 - Invalid Credentials
This test combines a wrong email and wrong password to showcase handling invalid login credentials.

### Test Case 5 - Place and Order
This test demonstrates the process of placing an order on a sample e-commerce site, emphasizing explicit waits for various steps, such as selecting a product, filling out recipient details, and completing the checkout.
